# ~/.dotfiles/

This is what I use every day. These configs define my workflow for writing
prose, programming, and other day-to-day computer things.

Currently, my setup is as such:

* Arch Linux
* Awesome WM
* URxvt for a terminal emulator
* tmux for everything
* Vim for everything, generally inside of tmux
* ZSH

I also use a Macbook at work, so I try and keep these dotfiles as OS-agnostic as
I can, but some stuff simply doesn't work on OSX. I primarily target these at my
Linux desktops, any OSX-compatability is probably accidental.

I also have various left-overs from XFCE, Openbox, and others, so switch window
managers for a nice surprise now and then!
