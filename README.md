# ~/.dotfiles/

This is what I use every day for work, play, and everything else.

Setup is fairly simple; check out the `Makefile`, or just run:

```bash
$ git submodule init && git submodule update
$ make
```

The Makefile simply copies the files out of the `configs/` folder and into `~/`.
This allows you to, for example, add passwords to configuration files, without
accidentally committing them or being annoyed by constant untracked changes (as
would be the case if you symlinked them).
