This is what I use every day for code, prose, and other fun stuff like that.

Setup is fairly simple; check out the `Makefile`.

```
$ make setup
$ make install
```

There are also things that are just for Linux or OSX. These are also simple to
install:

```
$ make osxinstall
$ make linuxinstall
```

Then you're done!
